# If you see a cell with a value of 0.44 between MLTV  and Width, it indicates a strong positive correlation. This means that as the baseline fetal heart rate increases, the percentage of time with abnormal short-term variability also tends to increase.
# 
# If thereâ€™s a cell with a value of -0.35 between ALTV  and Width, it indicates a strong negative correlation. This means that as uterine contractions increase, the late decelerations tend to decrease.

# Positive Correlations: Variables like LB and ASTV, UC and DL show strong positive correlations, indicating that they tend to increase together.
# Negative Correlations: Variables like LB and DL, LB and DP show negative correlations, indicating that as one increases, the other tends to decrease.
# No Significant Correlation: Variables like FM and most other variables show very low correlation coefficients, indicating no significant relationship.
# 
# 
# Interpretation
#  
# Strong Positive Correlation: LB and ASTV (0.70) suggest that higher baseline fetal heart rates are associated with more abnormal short-term variability.
# Strong Negative Correlation: LB and DL (-0.50) suggest that higher baseline fetal heart rates are associated with fewer late decelerations.
# Strong Positive Correlation: UC and DL (0.60) suggest that more frequent uterine contractions are associated with more late decelerations, potentially indicating fetal distress.
